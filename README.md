# Malawi Public Health Systems: 2nd Place Solution Overview

## About the Project
This repository contains the implementation of the 2nd place solution for the Malawi Public Health Systems Challenge. The project leverages the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model to enhance public health advisory by integrating structured public health data from various authoritative sources.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:
- Improve the accuracy and contextuality of health advisories using structured public health data.
- Provide dynamic, reliable health information tailored to user queries.
- Enhance user engagement and trust in digital health platforms.

## System Architecture
The system is designed with a robust architecture involving several components:
- **Data Extraction**: Automated scripts to extract data from provided health booklets.
- **Data Transformation**: Refinement of data to suit model requirements and improve response accuracy.
- **Data Loading**: Efficient data storage and retrieval systems for fast access and query processing.
- **Model Training**: Utilization of advanced NLP techniques and transformer models for generating relevant responses.
- **Inference and Deployment**: Setup for model deployment and response handling to ensure high availability and scalability.
